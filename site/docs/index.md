## Sy is back in development

Development is underway on the next iteration on the Syscript concept! The `sisy` interpreter will soon become the standard implementation - this version will be a compiled program written in Rust which interprets sy files. Compared to the current Python implementation, it will be much faster. Because Python itself is interpreted, the sy code is basically interpreted twice, making it very slow. This new implementation is only Singly Interpreted (the name `sisy` itself means singly interpreted sy).

## Why

- I'm interested in writing programming languages.

- A coworker and I have frequently joked about using an abnormal or esoteric language for a project, so this is my attempt at writing a language to fit that description.

- I liked the wiki article for [OISCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-instruction_set_computer).
