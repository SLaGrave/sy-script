# The Sy scripting language

A small, incredibly useless language.

```
   _____                     _       _   
  / ____|                   (_)     | |  
 | (___  _   _ ___  ___ _ __ _ _ __ | |_ 
  \___ \| | | / __|/ __| '__| | '_ \| __|
  ____) | |_| \__ \ (__| |  | | |_) | |_ 
 |_____/ \__, |___/\___|_|  |_| .__/ \__|
          __/ |               | |        
         |___/                |_|        
```

## How

Write a script and call it with syscript.py. A tutorial on the whole "write a script" step can be found [here](write.md).

```sh
$ python syscript ./hello.sy
```

## Why

- I'm interested in writing programming languages.

- A coworking and I have frequently joked about using an abnormal or esoteric language for a project, so this is my attempt at writing a language to fit that description.

- I liked the wiki article for [OISCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-instruction_set_computer).
